# F28WP-lab1
My name is Karim I'am a year2 CS student with HWID:H00360576. In this repositry I will be working on a travel agency website. Specifically working on the HTML, CSS, and javascript codes to improve it's design and functionality over the weeks of semester1. In week3 I have created a slideshow for the images in the gallery and a registeration form.

I deleted the old html code in gallery.html to remove the old contents then I created the slideshow providing the images source in each div class=myslide and and added the css provided to the page in the style.css file. Afterwards I created a seperate file called gallery.js to add functioanlity to the next and prev buttons, update the slides numbers and update the dispalyed slide according to the users actions.
